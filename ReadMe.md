My ultimate goal for this project is for me to learn more about using classes together better in order to make a single project

The project of building a life game interested me because of the idea of creating games seams like someting that I want to do and this is one of my first bigger projects that I worked on that was working together with many moving parts

Everything I attempted I found a way for it to work out I spent a lot of time with trial and error on some things and found a way for it to work

What I learned from this project is that I need to work more on just coding fun projects to increase my abillity and knowledge of coding
